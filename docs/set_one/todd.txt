I don’t mean to nag. I know I keep bringing this up, but I’ve got concerns about the direction of the Festival. 

You brought me onto the Board for my expertise on American folk music. I’ve been traveling, recording this stuff for years. I know what I’m hearing, seeing. Every year, this festival is one of the largest events in the country, the largest presentation of “folk” music in the world — and we’re not doing it justice.

Big names like Dob Billon — they’re not folk. Might play an acoustic guitar, might sing about social change, progress and all… But anything that’s commercial, contemporary like that, it’s just a replica. Written to be recorded, for profit. We set out to find the real thing. From the dirt, you know. 

These last few festivals, our traditional acts are just getting completely overshadowed. They’re not getting enough stage time — can’t get through their own sets without people calling for the big names. Don’t even get to speak before they play.

I realize that to sell tickets, we’ve gotta book some of the big names. But I’m confident we can do better. A lot better.

I know some guys in the field who are doing interesting work. I’m sending them your way. Please approve their budgets. Let’s stay true to our mission.  

Best,
Todd
