Dear ^firstName, 

Todd gave me your contact information.

My name is Richard Blank, and I am a prominent collector and analyst of blues, soul and jazz records. In a recent trip to Savannah, I identified and procured an extremely rare recording of Tim Jenkins at an antique shop. As far as I know, only a few hundred copies still exist. Its cover was in tatters, but after wiping away a thick coat of dirt, I listened to a full side of Tim for the first time.

As I’m sure you know, very little is known about Tim, life or death. Don’t even have a picture of him on the cover of the record. He only recorded a few sides during the 20’s, no known public appearances. However, while listening, I discovered that one of the subjects of his songs is a small town in Mississippi -- Camelot. 

I have already booked a flight to Camelot to search for any additional materials to gain a better picture of his life and music. I was hoping you that you could grant me a tape recorder for my trip. I would like to conduct interviews with anyone who knew him. Our understanding of the blues is utterly complete without him. 

Attached is my budget, as well as a photograph of my record. I appreciate your consideration. 

Thank you,
Richard Blank
