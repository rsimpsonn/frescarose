Hey ^firstName,

Found the harmonica player, talked to him. He won't budge. Says he won't play for white audiences.

Tried to explain to him over and over the opportunity we're offering. Chance to play for the largest audience ever, record with some major labels... He's persistent.

But the harmonica, I'm telling you, it's worth it. Here are some recordings. Got him on tape. The sound's just too much to lose out on.

I'm gonna stick around another day, see what I can do.

Best,
Don
