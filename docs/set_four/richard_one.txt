Dear ^firstName,

I've been in Somewhere the last few days recording interviews, hanging around the town... and you won't believe what I discovered.

I presumed he was dead, but Tim Jenkins is alive. He's been holed up in Mississippi, hasn't recorded at all since the Depression. He's just been playing for small audiences at home. Around town at bars, parties... He's a fixture, just like my record. 

It's the same sound too. The fingerpicking, the sweet, smooth melody in his voice. The other night, I just sat in his home and drank his brother's whiskey. Tried to sit up just like I do when I listen to the record. Chair wasn't quite the same, and without A/C I got a bit sweaty. There were a few points his voice broke where I wasn't used to.

I'm going to try to record him over the next week. I'll send you updates.

Best,
Richard Blank
