^firstName,

Got into Mississippi this afternoon and found the bar the guys were talking about. Smooth trip over, easy travels. 

They weren't kidding. This guy's harmonica is unbelievable. Got this howling drive to all of it. To think that only a few years ago, nobody we knew of was playing with these things. The instrument is just... fierce.

Anyway -- we got to the bar. Walked around for a minute, checked out the place. It was one of a few shacks nearby. We walked in and were the only white people there. Bunch of people dancing, just the harmonica player and a guy playing a rundown drumset. I've listened to quite a few blues tunes, and that bum shack was home to some of the best I've ever seen.

Few minutes went by — we got a lot of stares — and the harmonica player told us to leave. Got out of there, but I didn't get to record anything. I think if I got a second with him I could get him to Frescarose too.

Should we stay the night and try to find him or should we head back?
