Hey ^firstName,

I don't know if you already got a chance to see this, but the Rolling Stones, that big new band out of the UK, played on Shindig! last night. 

The guy who opened for him -- Howlin Wolf -- I've seen him play a bunch here in Chicago. The bars go wild for him. Dancing, singing, just crazy. This was the first time he's been on television, apparently he’s one of the band’s heroes.

My head is where yours is at. This electric stuff doesn’t sound right. Not the blues we discovered. But you see what the Stones are doing — it might have an audience…

I know I've already pressed you about meeting with Checkers Records. Just seeing if this would change your mind. Might not be your kind of music, but you see the audience he's getting.

Best,
Pete
