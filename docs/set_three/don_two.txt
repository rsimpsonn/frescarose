^firstName,

Got it, I think staying in Nashville must've been the right decision too -- I was around downtown last night and met the Harmonica Wizard -- Dominic Bales, the first ever black guy to play for the Opry radio show. 

His reputation's spot on. I mean, this guy's harmonica is unbelievable. Got this howling drive to all of it. To think that only a few years ago, nobody we knew of was playing with these things. The instrument is just... fierce.

He got phased out of Opry after playing for them for 15 years. The managers fired him cause they said he was unwilling to learn new material. He told me, though, that he wanted to play new material, but was told to play what the audience liked. Don't know a whole lot more, but I found him shining shoes.

I approached him about performing at Frescarose, but he said in no uncertain terms that he didn't want to perform for white audiences. I know I'm supposed to leave Nashville tomorrow, but I'd like to stay and convince him otherwise. With his talent, he'd be a great act at Frescarose, and I think we could get him a record deal.

Should I stay in Nashville and try to convince him or head back?
