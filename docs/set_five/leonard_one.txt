Hey ^firstName,

Gotcha -- confirming we can do Fred's performance acoustic. Just got off the phone with him, he sounds great. He’s singing all the old folk songs, sounds just like the records. We can have him play alone, sitting instead of standing. Just like the old times. 

How’s that sound?

Best,
Leonard
