Don't understand why you ignored Richard. You never know what kind of recordings we'd get. Never even been to that area in Mississippi. Could've found some performers. How are we gonna make this a folk festival if you're not willing to discover folk?

Regardless, I’ve been in Texas the past few weeks. Had an interesting interview with an informant the other day. Works on a crew that maintains a railroad section. Took a while to get him to talk up about their work songs, but ended up getting tape of him. The informant brought out a section of rail and two knives to play on -- kept singing these throaty falsetto yells between verses. 

Just fascinating stuff. Shows just how much life you can discover — none of this is getting saved without our work. This is the heart of America, the heart of music. Nothing commercial’s touched this — it’s just expression, art in its purest form.  

Made me think about informants more. I forwarded this manual to Richard — it’s his first time in the field. There’s an art to all this — isn’t always easy to get informants to speak up. Tell us what they know, you know? Attached are the instructions if you could forward them to any others that are conducting fieldwork.
