Hey ^firstName,

Thanks for getting back to me. I definitely think going authentic’s the right decision. There’s so much about him that’s folk. Everything is, really. The story is him, an exciting example.

If we’re going this route, I figure we gotta focus on his earlier stages. Back when you first discovered him in Louisiana, you know — I saw you wrote that his voice was in best shape right then, right before you first started putting him in front of the college audiences.

I’ve heard the story I want. The man on horseback, guitar slung over his shoulder. Coming home from a long day working, a broken back and a song in his soul. Drinking pints of homemade gin straight. That was Lowrider.

Tradition, man, it’s just got him — somewhere in the image of America’s roots. Everyone’s gonna love the stuff, and what makes them dig is that they are Americans, and that this music, in thousands of subtle ways, sums up their feelings, their inheritance, and their aspirations. Nothing kooky about this whatsoever. 

I think we should try to steer towards his older recordings too (I attached an older and newer one so you get the difference), try to get back to the kind of stuff we would have heard before he got big. Real folky. You up for that?

Best,
Paul
