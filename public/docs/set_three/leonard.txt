Dear ^firstName,

Leonard Checkers here, head of Checkers Records. Your guy Pete told me you might be interested in booking some of my guys for Frescarose. I think this could be an incredible partnership. 

Based on your board members and past concerts, I'm guessing that these Chicago blues aren't really your thing. Guys like Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, they've been playing with electric guitars for about two decades now. It's loud, you know. They're yelling, there's this incredible heat and profundity to all of it.

But since people like you started getting interested in the old Delta blues again, we started cutting some old-timey records. Rocking chairs, acoustic guitars, that whole bit, you know? Got some of it attached.

Anyways, we can get to the specifics later -- Wolf will already be near Frescarose next week, how about we get a performance on the books?

Best,
Leonard Checkers
