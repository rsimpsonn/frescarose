Hey ^firstName,

I don't know if you already got a chance to see this, but the Rolling Stones, this crazy new band out of the UK, played on Shindig! last night. 

The guy who played first -- Howlin Wolf -- I've seen him play a bunch here in Chicago. The bars go wild for him. Dancing, singing, just crazy. This was the first time he's been on television, apparently he was one of the band's biggest influences.

I know I've already pressed you about meeting with Leonard. Just seeing if this would change your mind. Might not be your kind of music, but you see the audience he's getting.

Best,
Pete
