I don’t mean to nag. I know I keep bringing this up, but I’ve got concerns about the direction of the Festival. 

You brought me onto the Board for my expertise on American folk music. I’ve been traveling, recording this stuff for years. It’s my purpose, my domain — believe me, I know what I’m doing. I know what I’m hearing. Every year, this Festival is one of the largest events in the country, the largest presentation of “folk” music in the world — and we’re not doing it justice.

These big names that you’re booking — they’re just not folk. Might be the same instruments, similar kinda music… But it’s commercial — written to be recorded, distributed to the masses. You started this foundation to display and preserve tradition. This music isn’t tradition. It isn’t folk.  

These last few festivals, our traditional acts are just getting completely overshadowed. They’re not getting enough stage time — they’re getting rushed through songs. Don’t even get to speak before they play. We’re not doing enough for them.

I realize that to sell tickets, we’ve gotta book some of the big names. But I’m confident we can do better. A lot better.

I know some guys in the field who are doing interesting work. I’m sending them your way. Please approve their budgets. Let’s stay true to our mission.  

Best,
Todd
