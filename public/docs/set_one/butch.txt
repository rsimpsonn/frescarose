Dear ^firstName,

I do hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you to begin our discussions about booking for the 2022 Frescarose Folk Festival. 

I believe that our partnership last year was a resounding success. My clients gained tremendous exposure playing in your historic event, and I have since recorded a number of your smaller acts. Letâ€™s keep this going.

Attached is a list of artists that I believe would be interested in playing at your festival. I represent many more who would be interested if you were to raise your pay. 

Check out that list and get back to me with any artists you would like to consider booking. Looking forward to your reply. 

Sincerely,
Butch Casserole
