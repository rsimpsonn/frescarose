Dear ^firstName,

I do hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you to begin our discussions about booking for the 2022 Frescarose Folk Festival. 

I believe that our partnership last year was a resounding success. My clients gained tremendous exposure playing in your historic event, and I have since recorded a number of your smaller acts.

Attached is a list of artists I believe you’d be interested in. They’ve all got that acoustic singsong thing you’re looking for. Real folky. Also happen to be topping the charts. I represent many more who would be interested if you were to raise your pay. 

Check out that list and get back to me with any artists you would like to book. Looking forward to your reply. 

Sincerely,
Butch Casserole
