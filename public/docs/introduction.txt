The Frescarose Folk Festival is a critically-acclaimed one-day annual concert held in a suburban area near you. The event has been hugely responsible for the development and preservation of folk music. Its history spans nearly a century, featuring some of the largest acts in music, as well as many traditional, or ethnic, acts. 

The festival is run by a non-profit organization, which in addition to the festival, funds numerous grants for research and fieldwork in folk music. 

You are in charge of booking acts for one iteration of the Frescarose event occurring during the mid-1960's. You control the budget and staff to identify and procure talent. The success of the concert relies on your decisions.
