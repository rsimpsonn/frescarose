Dear ^firstName, 

Todd gave me your contact information.

My name is Richard Blank, and I am a prominent collector and analyst of blues, soul and jazz records. In a recent trip to Savannah, I identified and procured an extremely rare recording of Tim Jenkins at an antique shop. Its cover was in tatters, but after wiping away a thick coat of dirt, I listened to a full side of Tim for the first time. His picking style is like no other. 

As I’m sure you know, very little is known about Tim, life or death. He only recorded a few sides during the 20’s, no known public appearances. However, while listening, I discovered that one of the subjects of his songs is a small town in Mississippi, Somewhere. 

I have already booked a flight to Mississippi to search for any additional materials to gain a better picture of his life and music. I was hoping you that you could grant me a tape recorder for my trip. I would like to conduct interviews with anyone who knew him. Our understanding of the blues is utterly complete without him. 

Attached is a full layout of my budget, as well as a photograph of my record. I appreciate your consideration. 

Thank you,
Richard Blank
