Hey ^firstName,

Hoping you could forward Todd Lorax his earnings report for his March royalties (attached).

Man, I played some of your recordings of Bellylead the other day, and I just can’t help thinking about what it would have been like to bring him to Frescarose. What a shame, lost him too soon. And I don’t mean his newer stuff, when he wore the tux, you know? I mean the old stuff — I was looking at the photos of him in overalls, stripes.

I’m setting up a tribute for the festival — gonna write something for the program, get some guys playing his songs. Express how much of folk today relies on the work you did together. 

I figure we could do this in one of two ways:

1) Play his music like he did — use a 12-string, play in his image, talk about his life between the songs. Put on a performance like he would.
2) Play his music as covers — let the artists play his work in their own styles. I might advise against this one — other artists aren’t gonna get him. For example, and I mean no disrespect to the Weevers, but their style's different than Bellylead's (I’ve attached recordings of both). In my opinion, it just doesn’t capture his soul. 

Let me know which direction you want me to go. 

Best,
Paul
