^firstName,

It's ^bigNameArtist. Butch let me know you want me to play at Frescarose again. Happy to. The sun doesn't sleep too long, ya know?

Heads up though -- last year's gone. If it isn't for you, it is for me and you have the wrong man. Whatever torch you passed me is in the other guy's hands. I'm not your freedom, your unity, whatever you write in the journals. The songbird, I'm not.

I'm singing different songs -- they're all mine now. Don't know what they're about and you won't either. But don't you worry about a thing. The leaves that fall today will be your appliances tomorrow.
