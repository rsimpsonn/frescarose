^firstName, 

The music’s crazy over here in Nashville. Just like we thought. I’ve got a bunch of stuff on tape for you, got phone numbers too — definitely a few prospects for Frescarose. 

Anyways, I was at a bar on Friday, playing cards with one of the country singers. The guy’s from Texas, late-30’s. Big ballad singer. Cowboy hat. Plays the mandolin. Nothing too special. But he started telling me about this harp player in middle-of-nowhere Mississippi. 

Said he and his buddy stopped for gas one afternoon driving through. Didn’t think anybody was around. But then they started hearing the harp out of some shack. Said it was like nothing they ever heard. They stood there for a bit, some of the best blues they ever heard.

Sounds like our kind of thing. 

He circled the destination on my map, looks like it’s about 450 miles away. I could get that done this week. Tape and gas would cost us 5. Am I good to go?
