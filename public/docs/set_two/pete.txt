Hey ^firstName,

I’m up in Chicago right now — a whole lot’s going on. 

Checkers Records has this whole group of blues artists recording together. Guys from the South, but their music’s nothing like what we’re used to in the Delta. They’re all on electric guitars, they’re performing with backing bands. It’s loud, and they’re packing these nightclubs in the South Side. They’re cutting a lot of records, attached are a few photos.

From what I can tell, there are really three qualities that distinguish these blues:

1) The high volume level
2) A highly polished wedding of vocal and instrumental lines (this may hark back to country dances and jam sessions of many decades ago)
3) This tangible but mysterious rhythmic factor called swing

I’m not sure if this stuff has a place at Newport, but I want to get you in touch with the company. Could I connect you with the head of Checkers?

Best,
Pete
