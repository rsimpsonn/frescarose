Hey ^firstName,

Been in Chicago the last few weeks. Checkers Records has this whole group of blues artists here recording together. Guys from Mississippi, but their music’s nothing like what we’re used to in the Delta. They’re all on electric guitars, they’re performing with backing bands. It’s loud, and they’re packing nightclubs. They’re cutting a lot of records, attached are a recording and a few photos.

This isn’t our normal sit-down stuff. Another shade of the blues, maybe, but nothing we’re used to. People are moving around, my ears ring for hours after. Musicians are in suits, standing with amped-up instruments. And there’s just so much hardware — all these speakers and wires, doesn’t seem like you’d need all this just to play the blues.  

But they’re packing these clubs. You want me to connect you with the head of Checkers?

Best,
Pete
