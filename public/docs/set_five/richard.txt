Dear ^firstName,

I've been making recordings of Tim Jenkins over the past few days. Been trying to get his sound just like the original records. And it's working. 

He was already pretty close but we've been getting the details down and he's got that same sound back. Just had the record going on repeat. I've mentioned Frescarose a few times to him and he seems interested. 

He's a legend in the blues circles I talk to. I think he'd be a huge act for the concert -- everyone would see his sound back from the dead, sweet as ever.

Let me know if we should book him.

Best,
Richard Blank
