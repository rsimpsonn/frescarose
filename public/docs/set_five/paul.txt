Hey ^firstName, 

Thank you for the reply. Got the Lowrider tribute all mapped out for you.

I’ve got a few blues musicians from Chicago ready to play some of the early recordings of Lowrider. I’m setting up a stage with a single chair — a rocking chair. Trying to get that small-time feel, right out of the recordings. Got them to play with just 12-string acoustic guitars, no backing bands or anything. A few of them have never played with 12 strings, but they got some time. 

Let me know if we should move forward.

Best,
Paul
