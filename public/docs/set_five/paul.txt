Hey ^firstName, 

Thank you for the reply. Got it all mapped out for you. Attached is a description and a final budget for the tribute. 

I’ve got a few blues musicians from Chicago ready to play some of your early recordings of Leadbelly. I’m setting up a stage with a single chair — a rocking chair. Trying to get that small-time feel, right out of the recordings. Got them to play with just 12-string acoustic guitars, no backing bands or anything. A few of them have never played with 12 strings, but they got some time. 

You know, Leadbelly had heard the slow blues from prostitutes all along the route that ran from Fannin Street in Shreveport, Louisiana, to Deep Elm in Dallas, Texas. He had heard and worked to the rhythms of untold work songs. The tradition seeps out your recordings like honey, that voice just sticks. It’s a shame that with everything you brought him, all the songs and the exposure, he still died mostly unknown.

Check out the budget and get back to me with any changes.

Best,
Paul
