Dear ^firstName,

Leonard Checkers here, head of Checkers Records. Your guy Pete told me you might be interested in booking some of my guys for Frescarose.

From what I know about Frescarose, I’m guessing these Chicago blues aren’t your thing. Guys like Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, they’ve been playing with electric guitars for two decades now. It’s loud, there’s a heat to all of it. 

It's been a while since these artists were in Mississippi. These guys are playing full-time, packing clubs, selling records. Can’t say it’s reached much outside the black community, though.

But since people like you got back into the Delta blues, we’ve been getting our guys ready with that sound again. Quieter folk stuff. We’ve got new records, guys ready to perform with acoustic instruments and no backing bands. Got some recordings attached that shows we can do both.

I’ve already got a musician on tour near Frescarose, Fred Green, who I think would be great. Just get back to me with how you want him to perform. 

Best,
Leonard Checkers
