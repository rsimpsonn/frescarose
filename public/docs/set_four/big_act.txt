How's the happening? Need you to get a few more amps for Frescarose than planned. I'll need a full drum kit, amps for rhythm and lead guitars and a bass. My next album's all electric -- amped up, loud. Got a sample here for you. Move time over a few notches, you know?

Back in New York I just wanted to be Woody Guthrie. The guitar, the harmonica, the songs, got it all from him. That folk sound took me all the way from Greenwich to these big stages. But at some point you gotta realize what belongs when. 

Your people might not know what's coming, but then again, who does? Break the clock, send the guards packing. The queen's on her toes and we're all in the water.
