How's the happening? Need you to get a few more amps for Frescarose than planned. I'll need a full drum kit, amps for rhythm and lead guitars and a bass. My next album's all electric -- amped up, loud. High volume, rock and roll. Move time over a few notches, you know?

Your people might not know what's coming, but then again, who does? Break the clock, send the guards packing. The queen's on her toes and we're all in the water.

Got a sample here for you.
