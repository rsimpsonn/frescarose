Hey ^firstName,

Quick idea I just had for the Bellylead tribute. Remember when we had the Texas Prisoners Worksong group a few years ago? It was Lorax's idea -- had a group of 6 ex-convicts sing work songs while chopping a tree stump with axes. Really powerful performance.

Lorax discovered Bellylead while he was still in jail in Texas. He had him sing so much traditional stuff, really taught him the image. So much so that after their partnership ended, Bellylead started to play in the old prison uniform. 

Wondering if we should do a similar thing in the tribute. Maybe we could have the musicians perform in stripes or on a railroad or a farm. Talk about showing an authentic performance.

What do you think?

Best,
Paul
