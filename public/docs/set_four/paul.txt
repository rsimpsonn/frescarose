Hey ^firstName,

Quick idea I just had for the Lowrider tribute. Remember when we had the Texas Prisoners Worksong group a few years ago? It was Lorax's idea -- had a group of 6 ex-convicts sing work songs while chopping a tree stump with axes. Really powerful performance.

Lorax discovered Lowrider while he was still in jail in Texas. He had him sing so much traditional stuff, really taught him the image. So much so that after their partnership ended, Lowrider started to play in the old prison uniform. 

Wondering if we should do a similar thing in the tribute. Maybe we could have the musicians perform in stripes or on a railroad or a farm. Think we would give everyone some perspective, you know?

What do you think?

Best,
Paul
